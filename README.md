# 📘 RL Study Repository  
A structured collection of paper summaries, experiments, and notes on **Reinforcement Learning**, **Robotics**, and **World Model–based Control**

This repository documents my continuous study journey in RL —  including reading foundational and cutting-edge papers, implementing key algorithms, and exploring how reinforcement learning can integrate with world models, transformers, and large vision-language-action (VLA) systems

## 🎯 Study Focus

I am currently interested in the following research directions:



### 🔹 **1. World Models**
- Learning latent dynamics of environments  
- Imagination-based rollouts and latent-space control  
- Generative dynamics models such as Dreamer, World Model
- Using sequence models for temporal consistency and planning  

### 🔹 **2. Action Planning**
- Vision-Language-Action models such as **RT-2**  
- Transformer-based planners and trajectory modeling  
- Long-horizon action generation  
- Language-conditioned control and grounding  
- Diffusion-based or generative planning approaches  

### 🔹 3. **Robotics**
- Cognitive Robotics: Developing robots that can actually think by bridging high-level reasoning with low-level motor control
- Human-like Interaction: Achieving human-level dexterity and natural movement in the real world
- General-purpose Agents: Building foundation models for robots to act in any environment

This repository serves as a long-term study log for combining these ideas  
toward building robust and general-purpose control agents.
