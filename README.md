# 📘 RL Study Repository  
A structured collection of paper summaries, experiments, and notes on  
**Reinforcement Learning**, **Robot Learning**, and **World Model–based Control**.

This repository documents my continuous study journey in RL —  
including reading foundational and cutting-edge papers, implementing key algorithms,  
and exploring how reinforcement learning can integrate with  
world models, transformers, and large vision-language-action (VLA) systems.

## 🎯 Study Focus

I am currently interested in the following research directions:


### 🔹 **1. Model-Free Reinforcement Learning**
- Scalable off-policy actor-critic methods (e.g., SAC, TD3)  
- Representation learning for RL agents  
- Efficient value-based or policy-based control  
- Understanding generalization and stability in model-free RL

### 🔹 **2. World Models**
- Learning latent dynamics of environments  
- Imagination-based rollouts and latent-space control  
- Generative dynamics models such as Dreamer, World Model, TR2  
- Using sequence models for temporal consistency and planning  

### 🔹 **3. Action Planning**
- Vision-Language-Action models such as **RT-2**  
- Transformer-based planners and trajectory modeling  
- Long-horizon action generation  
- Language-conditioned control and grounding  
- Diffusion-based or generative planning approaches  

This repository serves as a long-term study log for combining these ideas  
toward building robust and general-purpose control agents.
